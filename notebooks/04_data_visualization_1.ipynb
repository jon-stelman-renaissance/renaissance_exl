    "Now that we can load, select, and transform data, it's time to unpack some of the more important aspects of data visualization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "As a data researcher, we generally use data visualization for one of three purposes:\n",
    "1. **Research:** To help ourselves better understand the data, by \"asking questions\" of datasets\n",
    "2. **Storytelling**: To highlight and communicate important details about the data for other stakeholders\n",
    "3. **Dashboard**: To provide stakeholders with a way to easily answer pre-defined questions about dynamic datasets\n",
    "  \n",
    "This notebook addresses the first two of these. The latter topic, dashboards, generally require greater interactivity. Because of the greater complexity involved, we'll save that topic for another time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### `matplotlib`\n",
    "\n",
    "[`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) is a Python library for plotting. In their words:\n",
    "> Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.\n",
    "  \n",
    "There are many tools and libraries available for data visualization and plotting. Each has its own strengths. This tutorial favors `matplotlib` because it is easy to use \"out-of-the-box.\" `pandas` has integrated `matplotlib` methods, to very easily make simple plots of data in DataFrames and Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Visualization for Research\n",
    "As data researchers, we often need to quickly explore the shape of data, scanning for information about distributions, trends, clusters, and outliers. Here, we put the emphasis on function over form. We want to make a plot quickly so we can move on to the next question. In a Jupyter Notebook, our plot will appear right below the code that created it, so we might be okay with skipping over aspects like titles, grids, color, axis labels, or pre-configured axis ranges. We'll pay those aspects much more attention when doing data visualization for storytelling and dashboard applications."
